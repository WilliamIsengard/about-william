			<h2 class="subTitle">Who Am I?</h2>
				<p>My name is <strong>William Isengard</strong> and I am a new student at the CNM Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp. I am married to an awesome person named <strong>Andy</strong> and we have an incredible, 4-year old <em>aspiring scientist</em> named <strong>Leon</strong>.</p>
				<p></p>
			<h2 class="subTitle">What Do I Like To Do?</h2>
				<p>I enjoy comic books, movies, video games, and art. During my free time I focus on having adventures with Andy and Leon and trying to enrich Leon's life as much as possible. He generally starts and ends the day wanting to do science experiments and recently learned to solve a rubic's cube.</p>
				<p></p>
			<h2 class="subTitle">Why Am I Here?</h2>
				<p>I have a background in tech sales and solar sales/management. I previously managed the fast-growing local company NM Solar Group and left to pursue new interests. I co-own a commercial solar consulting/engineering company on the side. I have had a long-term goal of learning to code and I'm very excited to learn as much as I can through this bootcamp.</p>
