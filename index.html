		<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img src="william-pic.jpg" alt="William Isengard Picture" style="width:200px;height:200px;"/>
			<p>My name is William Isengard and I am a new student at the CNM Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp. I am married to an awesome person named Andy and we have an incredible, 4-year old aspiring scientist named Leon.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>I enjoy comics, movies, video games, and art. During my free time I focus on having adventures with Andy and Leon and trying to enrich Leon's life as much as possible. He generally starts and ends the day wanting to do science experiments and recently learned to solve a rubic's cube.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>I have a background in tech sales and solar sales/management. I previously managed the fast-growing local company NM Solar Group and left to pursue new interests. I co-own a commercial solar consulting/engineering company on the side. I have had a long-term goal of learning to code and I'm very excited to learn as much as I can through this bootcamp.</p>
